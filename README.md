# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Firstly, this work was created with the following considerations:

Creating one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

See the run_analysis.R file for details of the above.
